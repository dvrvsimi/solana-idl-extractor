Areas for Improvement
Binary Transaction Parsing
The extract_from_binary function uses a heuristic approach that might not work for all transactions
Could be enhanced with more robust transaction format parsing

Parameter Type Inference
Current heuristics for type detection are good but could be refined
Might benefit from machine learning approaches with more samples

Error Handling
Some error paths could use more detailed error messages
More graceful fallbacks when primary analysis methods fail

Test Coverage
The test suite appears to cover basic functionality
Could benefit from more comprehensive tests with real-world programs

Documentation
While there are comments, more detailed documentation on the analysis algorithms would be helpful
Interesting Components



Suggestions
Enhanced Type Inference
Consider adding more sophisticated type inference for complex data structures
Could use statistical analysis across multiple samples

Improved Account Structure Detection
The account structure detection could be enhanced to better identify nested structures
Consider adding support for detecting enums and custom types

Transaction Simulation
Adding transaction simulation capabilities could provide more insights
Would help validate the inferred IDL

Performance Optimization
Some analysis functions might benefit from parallelization
Consider caching intermediate results for frequently analyzed programs

Integration with Anchor IDL
Consider adding functionality to compare extracted IDL with official Anchor IDL
Could help validate the extraction process
