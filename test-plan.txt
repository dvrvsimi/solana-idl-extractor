Immediate Action Plan
Before writing tests, I recommend:
Verify Basic Functionality: Create a simple end-to-end test with a known program to verify the extraction pipeline works.
Implement Missing Components: Based on the code review, some functions appear to be incomplete or contain placeholder code.
3. Improve Error Handling: Enhance error reporting to provide more context about failures.
Add Logging: Implement comprehensive logging to help debug extraction issues.
